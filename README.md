# Evaluation-of-respiratory-disease-hospitalisation-forecasts-using-synthetic-outbreak-data

This repository contains code required to generate the results found in the manuscript "Evaluation of respiratory disease hospitalisation forecasts using synthetic outbreak data".

To run the code only requires a standard installation of Python preferably through Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download). The code has been tested on Python 3.11.7. 

The Python-notebooks named fig_x_*.ipynb generate all the figures in the manuscript.
